### Generated Python Code


from flask import Flask, render_template, request, redirect, url_for

app = Flask(__name__)

books = [
  {"id": 1, "title": "Book 1", "author": "Author 1", "genre": "Genre 1", "publication_date": "2023-01-01"},
  {"id": 2, "title": "Book 2", "author": "Author 2", "genre": "Genre 2", "publication_date": "2023-02-01"},
  {"id": 3, "title": "Book 3", "author": "Author 3", "genre": "Genre 3", "publication_date": "2023-03-01"},
]

@app.route("/")
def index():
  return render_template("index.html", books=books)

@app.route("/search", methods=["GET"])
def search():
  search_term = request.args.get("search_term")
  results = [book for book in books if search_term in book["title"]]
  return render_template("index.html", books=results)

@app.route("/book/<int:book_id>")
def book_details(book_id):
  book = next((book for book in books if book["id"] == book_id), None)
  if not book:
    return redirect(url_for("index"))
  return render_template("book_details.html", book=book)

if __name__ == "__main__":
  app.run(debug=True)


### Code Validation and Correction

**Variable Referencing:**

- The Assistant identified that the `book` variable used in `book_details.html` was not defined in the `book_details` route.
- To correct this, the Assistant added the line `book = next((book for book in books if book["id"] == book_id), None)` to the route.

**Error Handling:**

- The Assistant detected that there was no error handling in the `book_details` route if the book with the given ID was not found in the database.
- To address this, the Assistant added the following code: `if not book: return redirect(url_for("index"))`. This ensures that users are redirected to the home page if an invalid book ID is requested.
